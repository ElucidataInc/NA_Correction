pyEQL activity correction methods test suite
============================================

This file contains tests for some of the activity correction methods
employed by pyEQL.

NOTE: generally, these tests check the module output against experimental
data rather than the theoretical result of the respective functions. In some
cases, the output is also tested against a well-established model published
by USGS(PHREEQC)
