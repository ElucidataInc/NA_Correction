    pyexcel.ext
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Redirect imports for extensions.  This module basically makes it possible
    for us to transition from flaskext.foo to flask_foo without having to
    force all extensions to upgrade at the same time.

    When a user does ``from pyexcel.ext.foo import bar`` it will attempt to
    import ``from pyexcel_foo import bar`` first and when that fails it will
    try to import ``from pyexcelext.foo import bar``.

    We're switching from namespace packages because it was just too painful for
    everybody involved.

    This is used by `pyexcel.ext`.
