## **About the package**

Corna package performs Natural Abundance Correction on the output intensity of metabolites, obtained after performing Mass Spectrometry(MS).

**Natural Abundance Correction**- Natural abundance (NA) refers to the abundance of isotopes of a chemical element as naturally found on the planet. While performing analysis,the observed intensity contains contribution from isotopic natural abundance that needs to be corrected. This process is referred as NA Correction.

**Fractional enrichment**- Normalization of intensities of a metabolite between the range of 0 to 1.
